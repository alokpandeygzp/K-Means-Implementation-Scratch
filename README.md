# K-Means-Implementation-Scratch

In this project, I delved into the world of unsupervised learning by implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch using Python, without relying on inbuilt functions. This hands-on experience allowed me to gain a deep understanding of how K-Means works.
I didn't stop there! To evaluate the effectiveness of the clustering, I calculated various clustering validity indices, including the silhouette score and the Dunn index. These metrics provided valuable insights into the quality of the clusters formed by K-Means.
To visualize the impact of different initialization conditions, I ran the K-Means algorithm multiple times, capturing the results each time. This enabled me to plot and analyze the clustering validity indices across these runs, helping me make informed decisions about the optimal number of clusters.
As a bonus, I applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the Iris dataset, reducing its dimensionality while preserving the essential information. This not only streamlined the data but also showcased my ability to incorporate dimensionality reduction techniques into the analysis.
This project was a fantastic learning experience, allowing me to gain expertise in K-Means, explore clustering validity measures, and apply feature reduction techniquesâ€”a journey that has expanded my skills in machine learning and data analysis.
